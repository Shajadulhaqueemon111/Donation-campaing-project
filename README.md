# Ans:--

In this project, several unique features have been added. Firstly, on the home page, all donation cards are displayed uniquely. There's a search bar where you can enter the name of a card, and when you search, it will show the unique cards matching that name. Clicking on one of these cards opens a donation card, and when you click the donate button on that card, the donation amount is processed, and a suite alert opens. Percentages are used for handling donation amounts in this project.
